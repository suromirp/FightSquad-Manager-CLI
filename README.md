## ðŸ“„ Project Description

**FightSquad - CLI** is a command-line application developed as part of my HBO C# Backend Developer education.

This project builds upon a previous assignment, where basic object structures were hardcoded to demonstrate functionality. In this extended version, the user can create, modify, and delete teams and fighters interactively through a command-line interface.

The goal of the assignment was to replace hardcoded data with dynamic user input and provide full control through a structured text-based menu system. It focuses on object-oriented design, input validation, and clean separation of logic without relying on a graphical interface.

Additionally, the application includes a SQL database integration, allowing data to be persisted across sessions. This enables users to retain teams and fighters even after closing the application.
